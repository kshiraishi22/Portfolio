# Portfolio
Personal website highlighting my portfolio. Special thanks goes to @rbhatia46 for his portfolio template that he's made available to the public.

# How It's Built
The site was created using React.js. The bulk of the info on the website is in the resumedata.js file as an array and rendered through the use of different components.

# What's Included
A mixture of projects and homework assignments that I've completed thus far. Additional works will be added on as I complete them.
